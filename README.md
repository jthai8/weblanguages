LEARN Academy Challenge

Create a website of your Top 10 Web Languages.

This is a challenge in the use of Bootstrap.
As usual design the page however you like but use the Bootstrap 1 | 2 | 3 column layout
Spend minimal time on what images you want on the page and more time using Bootstrap to get the website to look how you want.
Some Bootstrap to include should be a jumbotron, some buttons and a navigation bar.
